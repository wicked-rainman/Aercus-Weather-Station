# The Aercus weather station

A few years ago, my wife bought me an Aercus weather station. It's sat there for a few years, sending it's readings to Weather Underground without fault.

After a while I simply got fed up of having to fire up a computer each time I wanted to see the readings and decided to make some changes.
